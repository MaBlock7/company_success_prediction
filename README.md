# Automated Venture Capitalist: Text-Based Prediction of Early-Stage Startup Success from Public Data

This repository contains the code for the master thesis "Automated Venture Capitalist: Text-Based Prediction of Early-Stage Startup Success from Public Data". The thesis aims to improve early-stage startup success prediction by combining administrative company data with website-derived strategic measures. I train binary classifiers to forecast four key startup outcomes within five years of founding:

- Involuntary exit (e.g., bankruptcy or liquidation)
- Acquisition by another firm
- Private investment (e.g., IPOs, venture capital)
- Innovation subsidies granted by Innosuisse, the Swiss innovation agency

The dataset includes approximately 110,000 Swiss startups founded between 2016 and 2020. This work demonstrates how publicly available web and registry data can be used to build scoring models to support the screening of newly founded firms and show that founding strategy matters for the outcome prediction.
